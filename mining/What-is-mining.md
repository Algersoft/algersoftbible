# **What is mining ?**

Cryptocurrency mining includes two functions, namely: adding transactions to the blockchain (securing and verifying) and also releasing new currency. Mining needs a device such as a computer or mobile device and a special program, which helps miners compete with their peers in solving complicated mathematical problems.

Mining is the process of adding transaction records to cryptocurency public ledger of past transactions. This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. Mining is so called because it resembles the mining of other commodities: it requires exertion and it slowly makes new currency available at a rate that resembles the rate at which commodities like gold are mined from the ground.
