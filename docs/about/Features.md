# **Kriegerrand Features**
## **Detailed List of Kriegerrands Features**

### **Privacy**

[KREGR](https://kriegerrand.com) uses ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses to obfuscate the origins, amounts, and destinations of all transactions. It means that nobody can track your transactions and knows that you made a transaction, it means also that nobody can see the content of your wallet/asset. Kriegerrand is 100 times more private than the Bitcoin. We use advanced mathematical analysis and innovative ideas to empower end-users with true privacy.

When you send or receive [KREGR](https://kriegerrand.com) through the Kriegerrand network, the sender, the receiver and the transacted amount are anonymous by default. Nobody can know if you sent or received Kriegerrand and nobody can know how much Kriegerrand you sent. All the transaction through the blockchain are untraceable and so it's impossible to link transactions to a particular user and so can't be linked to a real world identity even by the founder team of the BLOC. However we have a feature called the view key to offer transparency which is described next.

- CryptoNote System
- Analysis Resistent Blockchain
- SupraBlendr (Optional Mega Coin Mixer)
- TOR Optional Website
- No storing, collection, use of users
- No server logs 


### **Security**

Slower block time. Yup. You read that right. While 99% of the CryptoNote based currencys who advertise bleeding fast blocktimes of under a minute, we do the opposite. No, it's not to be rebelious edgelord hipster cucks, it's because we don't believe in sacraficing kriegerrands security in exchange for a convenience.  Research has shown us that if a coin grows in popularity, the fast blocktimes will likely lead too bigger issues. Such as Orphan blocks and double spend attacks. This longer blocktime 

A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.

Nobody can seize your BLOC. You are the only reponsible of your fund. You and only you can control your fund. You are your own bank.

### **Decentralized**

The decentralized control of [KREGR](https://kriegerrand.com) works through a blockchain, which is a public transaction database, functioning as a distributed ledger. The Blockchain is the technology allowing to send money without the need of intermediaries. Decentralized Kriegerrand cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which was defined when the system was created and which is publicly known. Unlike centralized banking and corrupted economic system, in this case companies or governements cannot produce new KREGR.

### **Developed to Adapt**

A decentralized payment system must not depend on a single person's decisions, even if this person is a developer. [KREGR](https://kriegerrand.com) has no hard-coded constants; magic numbers in the code are designed to be re-calculated based on the previous state of the network. Thus, they always change adaptively and independently, allowing the network to develop on its own. We are listening and encourage our community to vote and participate in different subject to make Kriegerrand better day by day.

[KREGR](https://kriegerrand.com) is optionnaly and on-demand transparent by address and by transaction. There is a thing called the view key. A view key is used to reveal all transactions for a Kriegerrand account, or just the key for a single transaction without being able to spend thos account funds. View keys can be given to selected parties, or can be made public for crowdfunding or charity events, children can be given their own accounts, and parents can monitor their spending. It's like: Hey! You can look, but you can't touch!

## **Fungible Price**
Def. : "being something (such as money) of such a nature that one part or quantity may be replaced by another equal part". It means that any [KREGR](https://kriegerrand.com) is equal in all point to any other KREGR. Whatever the previous use of the KREGR, it is always neutral as nobody can know where and when the Kriegerrand has been used previously. So each coins has no history on the blockchain. No one has the possibility to rewrite or modify the Blockchain ledger, the protocol is unalterable and incorruptible by nature.
