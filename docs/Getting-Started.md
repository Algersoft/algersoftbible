[Kriegerrand](https://kriegerrand.com) is privacy centered cryptocurrency that focuses on 5 primary core elements.

## **2. Mine the Cap. Score some KREGR via Mining**<a name="start-mining"></a>

As with most POW cryptocoins, the mining process has two main functions. Most importantly, it creates fresh Kriegerrands, and two, it escorts everyones transactions to the blockchain.  To take part in this miraculous experience in nature, you need some hardware (be it a beastly linux build with a 10 grand VGA investment, or a standard smartphone) and some specialized mining software.  Once those core elements are obtained you can begin rewarding yourself with them sweet sweet kriegerrands.
