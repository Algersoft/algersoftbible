Everyone can run a [Kriegerrand Mining Pool](https://bloc.money/mining), the more Kriegerrand mining pool it exist the better it is for the network. By running a Kriegerrand mining pool the pool operator can set up a % fees on each block mined from this mining pool. Usually this % varies from 0.1% to 5% depending of your mining pool.
