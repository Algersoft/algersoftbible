## **Mining from iOS**

We had to remove the mining features built in the original **KREGR** app to be able to distribute it on the official app store. It is very important for the **KREGR** to make the installation very easy and accessible to the most potential users.

That being said we are happy to publish our iOS app [open source](https://github.com/furiousteam/KREGR-iOS-wallet) including the miner so everyone can enjoy it.
