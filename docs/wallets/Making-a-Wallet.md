# **Making a Kriegerrand Wallet**

There are multiple different types of wallets you can choose to use for [KREGR](https://bloc.money), [Paper wallets](../wallets/Making-a-paper-wallet.md), [CLI Wallet](../wallets/Kriegerbank-how-to-use.md), [GUI Wallet](../wallets/Making-a-GUI-Wallet.md), [iOS Wallet](../wallets/KREGR-iOS-wallet.md), [Telegram Wallet](../wallets/KREGR-Telegram-Wallet.md) and Web Wallets (under development).

We recommend making a paper wallet so that you can start receiving funds, and later import them into a GUI or CLI wallet.

## **Kriegerrand Paper Wallet**

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI, Mobile, Telegram or Web Wallet.**

To view a guide on how to make a paper wallet, you can check out [this guide](../wallets/Making-a-paper-wallet.md).

## **Kriegerbank (CLI Wallet)**

The CLI Wallet, called [Kriegerbank](../wallets/Kriegerbank-how-to-use.md), is a multi-platform program (Win/Linux/Mac) that requires you to enter commands for it to work and you cannot use your mouse. It is text only application that does not have a graphical interface. However, it is currently the most stable and gets the newest updates first.

## **KREGR-service (RPC Wallet)**

KREGR-service RPC Wallet is a HTTP server which provides a [JSON 2.0 RPC interface](../wallets/bloc-service-json-api.md) for Kriegerrand payment operations and address management designed to manage a user's account while operating together with a BLOCd Node Daemon. KREGR-service RPC Wallet allows you to accept incoming payments, generate an address for each user and much more.

If you are looking to integrate Kriegerrand payment and process transactions into your website or application, **KREGR-service** is what you need.
