## **Wallet Optimization**

If you are mining, it is highly recommended to enable wallet optimization (Settings > Preferences > Wallet Optimization) because you will be more prone to transition getting stuck if you’re wallet isn’t optimized. Transaction size increases if you have many small transactions amount on your wallet, and try to send a big amount in one transaction.
